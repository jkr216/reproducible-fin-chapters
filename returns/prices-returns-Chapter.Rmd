Returns. 

Where are we headed in this chapter. 

From a practical perspective, here's what we need to do. 
Import prices for each of our assets. Here we will be building a 5-asset portfolio, that is balanced and diversified, we believe. 

We will import daily prices for our 5 assets since January 1, 2005. 

Our prices will be daily, consist of open, close, adjusted, volume, high, low. first decision: time period, which group - adjusted. then, which period, keep daily, convert to monthly, weekly, quarterly. we'll go with monthly. Now we have monthly prices for a certain time period for 5 stocks. we need to convert those prices to returns - what kind? log returns as will be important when we simulate. 

From a workflow perspective, we have just plunged into the data science process, which in the tidyverse we think of as beginning with data import and then progressing to data wrangling - which means getting the 'raw' data into the format we want to use. Here, the 'raw' data are a time series of prices for our 5 stocks, taken from Yahoo! finance. Important things to think about: 

The source - in industry, you almost certainly won't be pulling from yahoo! or google, you will have an internal database or data lake that holds the time series data. For anyone wishing to reproduce or reuse or build upon your work, a crucial first step is being able to import or update your raw data. It's a simple but oft overlooked first step that needs to be made clear. 

which dates? Why these dates? Does it matter? I chose 2005 as the start date so that we could observe the credit crunch/financial crisis of 2008. I think that's interesting. Maybe my colleagues think it's cherry picking, maybe my clients think I need to go back to before the internet bubble. They are entitled to to their opinions, and I to mine. The important thing is to briefly explain our reasoning, and make it easy for someone to test his/her own permutations. If a colleague looks at our work and wants to test a start date that goes back to the internet bubble, we need to enable that.

This harkens back to the reproducible mindset. It seems our colleague is questioning the validity of our decision, and we can respond in one of two ways. I could be offended and defensive, and reflect that in my code by not making it easy to poke my data import. Or I could welcome this as a way to make my code and hypotheses stronger. If my organization has a culture that punishes or rewards, that flow into my coding decisions. 

The most successful organizations are those that, at a minimum, make this seemless and ideally make this process part of the expectation. An analogy might be to academic research where findings are expected to be peer-reviewed and scrutinized. It's not an insult or a challenge, rather it's part of the normal treatment of any finding.  In the realm of portfolio analysis, step 1 in this process is being able to import the raw price data.

Here, when we are using publicly available data, it's quite easy for someone to change the dates, or even the assets. They can simply edit "2005-01-01" to whatever date is desired or drop in different ticker symbols. 

In industry, it might not be so simple. Do our colleagues have access to the database? Maybe we are putting together a bespoke portfolio for a client that doesn't want other analysts to know his identity - can we sanitize this data or have a data lake that has anonymized our portfolios? 

There are a lot of issues here, and note that we have not got past our first 8 lines of code.  This is a good time to reemphasize that the code is often times not the most difficult part of data science in finance. Here, the data import code is simple and easily reproducible. But, by making it simple and reproducible, and encouraging this as the standard for the data import step in our team's analysis, we create the expectation that our work is going to be reproduced, reused and re-tested under different assumptions.  The code is simple; the implications are not.  

Beyond culture, there's an alpha-generating payoff to setting the tone of reproducibility in step 1.  As we noted in the introduction, finance isn't physics and a good strategy today will most likely be arbitraged away tomorrow.  Models and strategies need to be constantly scrutinized and updated, and not just by the original creator of the strategy.  The right data import workflow is the first crucial step to reproducibility, and reproducibility allows for models to be updated as market conditions change.

Once we have finished and explained step 1, data import, we immediately started to change the raw data.

## Choose Portfolio Building Blocks and Import Prices

For this chapter we will be working with a 5-asset portfolio consisting of the following.

    + SPY (S&P500 fund) weighted 25%
    + EFA (a non-US equities fund) weighted 25%
    + IJS (a small-cap value fund) weighted 20%
    + EEM (an emerging-mkts fund) weighted 20%
    + AGG (a bond fund) weighted 10%

I chose those 5 assets because they seem to offer a balanced blend of large, small, international, emerging and bond exposure. We will include several Shiny apps with each chapter and that will afford the opportunity to choose different assets and see different results.  For the code included in this book, we will not change or deviate from these 5 assets.

On to step 1, wherein we import adjusted prices for the 5 ETFs to be used in our porftolio and save them to an `xts` object called `prices`.

We need a vector of ticker symbols that we will then pass to Yahoo! Finance via the `getSymbols` function from the `quantmod` package. This will return an object with the opening price, closing price, adjusted price, daily high, daily low and daily volume. We don't want to work with all of those, though. The adjusted price is what we need. 

To isolate the adjusted price, we use the `map` function from the `purrr` package and apply `Ad(get(.))` to the imported prices. This will 'get' the adjusted price from each of our individual price objects. We could stop here and have the right substance, but the format wouldn't be great as we would have a `list` of 5 adjusted prices. The `map` function returns a list by default. 

The `reduce(merge)` function will allow us to merge the lists into one object and coerce back to an `xts` structure.  Finally, we want intuitive column names and use `colnames<-` to rename the columns.  The `rename` function from `dplyr` will not work well here because the object structure is still `xts`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# The symbols vector holds our tickers. 
symbols <- c("SPY","EFA", "IJS", "EEM","AGG")

# The prices object will hold our raw price data throughout this book.
prices <- 
  getSymbols(symbols, src = 'yahoo', from = "2005-01-01", 
             auto.assign = TRUE, warnings = FALSE) %>% 
  map(~Ad(get(.))) %>% 
  reduce(merge) %>%
  `colnames<-`(symbols)

```

We now have an `xts` object of the adjusted prices for our 5 assets. Have a quick peek.

```{r}
head(prices)
```

## Convert Daily Prices to Monthly Log Returns

Next we want to turn those daily prices into monthly returns. This seems like a rather innocuous step in our work, but it involves two important decisions to be highlighted in the name of reproducibility. First, we are changing time periods from daily to monthly.  Not crucial, but we are transforming our data. We need to explain how that's happening.

More importantly, we will be transforming our data from its raw form, adjusted prices, to a calculated form, log returns.  

This is such a standard step that the temptation is to include a few lines of code and move on to the analysis, which is the stuff our team gets paid to do. But, converting to log returns is our first major data process decision: why did we choose log returns instead of simple returns? It's a standard practice to use log returns but it's also a good chance to set the precedent amongst our team and within our workflow that we justify and explain decisions about our data.  If we have made the decision to work with log returns across our work, we should point to an R Notebook or a PDF that explains the decision and the brief substantive justification.  

In this case, I know that simulating returns is in our future, and we will be assuming a normal distribution of returns. Thus, I choose to convert to log returns. In industry and when establishing a data science practice, an explanatory R Notebook can serve three purposes. First, for new team members, they will have a reference library that helps contextualize team-wide decisions.  Second, should anyone every ask, why have we chosen log returns as the standard? The team can point to the reference material, and invite theoretical disagreements should the questioner not agree with that material. Third, it sets the standard for a best practice: this team justifies decisions that affect our data and conclusions.  


### The XTS World

What is XTS? How diff from tidy

Our first reading in the `prices` object is from January 3, 2005 (the first trading day of that year) and we have daily prices.  Let's stay in the`xts`world and convert to monthly prices using a call to `to.monthly(prices, indexAt = "last", OHLC = FALSE)` from `quantmod`.  The argument `index = "last"` tells the function whether we want to index to the first day of the month or the last day. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
prices_monthly <- to.monthly(prices, indexAt = "last", OHLC = FALSE)

head(prices_monthly)

``` 

We have moved from an `xts` object of daily prices to an `xts` object of monthly prices.

Now we'll call `Return.calculate(prices_monthly, method = "log")` to convert to returns and save as an object called `assed_returns_xts`. Note this will give us log returns by the `method = "log"` argument. We could have used `method = "discrete"` to get simple returns.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
asset_returns_xts <- na.omit(Return.calculate(prices_monthly, method = "log"))

head(asset_returns_xts)
```

Take a quick look at the monthly returns above, to make sure things appear to be in order. Notice in particular the date of the first value. We imported prices starting "2005-01-01" yet our first monthly return is for "2005-02-28". This is because we used the argument `indexAt = "last"` when we cast to a monthly periodicity (try changing to `indexAt = "first"` and see the result).  That is not necessarily good or bad, but it might matter if that first month's returns makes a difference in our analysis and the broader issue is that our decisions in data transformation can affect the data that ultimately survives to our analytical stage.

From a subtantive perspective, we could stop right now. Our task has been accomplished: we have imported daily prices, trimmed to adjusted prices, moved to monthly prices and transformed to monthly log returns. 

For now, though, let's take a look at a few more methods.

### The Tidyverse and Tidyquant World

We now take the same raw data, which is the `prices` object we created upon data import and convert it to monthly returns using 3 alternative methods. We will make use of the `dplyr`, `tidyquant`, `timetk` and `tibbletime` packages and switch from the `xts` world to the tidy world.

Again, [the diff between xts and tidy, and briefly why we might want to.]

For our first method,  we use  `dplyr` and `timetk` to convert our object from an `xts` object of prices to a `tibble` of monthly returns. Once we convert to a `tibble` the tidyverse is available for all sort of manipulations. 

Let's step through the logic before getting to the code chunk.

In the piped workflow below, our first step is to use the `tk_tbl(preserve_index = TRUE, rename_index = "date")` function to convert from `xts` to `tibble`. The two arguments will convert the `xts` date index to a date column, and rename it "date". If we stopped here, we would have a new prices object in `tibble`  format. 

Next we turn to `dplyr` to `gather` our new dataframe into long format and then `group_by` asset. We have not done any calculations yet, we have just shifted from wide format, to long, tidy format. Notice that when we gathered our data, we renamed one of the columns to `returns` even though the data are still prices. The next step will explain why we did that.

Next, we want to calculate log returns and add those returns to the data frame.  We will use `mutate` and our own calculation to get log returns: `mutate(returns = (log(returns) - log(lag(returns))))`. Notice that I am putting our new log returns into the `returns` column by calling `returns = ...`. This is going to remove the price data and replace it with log returns data. This is the explanation for why, when we called `gather` in the previous step, we renamed the column to `returns`. That allows us to simply replace that column with log return data instead of having to create a new column and then delete the price data column.

Our last two steps are to `spread` the data back to wide format, which makes it easier to compare to the `xts` object and easier to read, but is not a best practice in the tidyverse. We are going to look at this new object and compare to the `xts` object above, so we will stick with wide format for now.   

Finally, we want to reorder the columns to align with the `symbols` vector. That's important because when we build a portfolio, we will use that vector to coordinate our different weights. 

```{r}
asset_returns_dplyr_byhand <- prices %>% 
  to.monthly(indexAt = "last", OHLC = FALSE) %>% 
  tk_tbl(preserve_index = TRUE, rename_index = "date") %>%
  gather(asset, returns, -date) %>% 
  group_by(asset) %>%  
  mutate(returns = (log(returns) - log(lag(returns)))) %>%
  spread(asset, returns) %>% 
  select(date, symbols) %>% 
  slice(-1)
```

For our second method in the tidy world, we'll use the `tq_transmute` function from `tidyquant`.  Instead of using `to.monthly` and `mutate`, and then supplying our own calculation, we use `tq_transmute(mutate_fun = periodReturn, period = "monthly", type = "log")` and go straight from daily prices to monthly log returns. Note that we select the period as 'monthly' in that function call, which means we can pass in the raw daily `prices` `xts` object.. 

```{r}
asset_returns_tq_builtin <- prices %>%
  tk_tbl(preserve_index = TRUE, rename_index = "date") %>%
  gather(asset, prices, -date) %>% 
  group_by(asset) %>%
  tq_transmute(mutate_fun = periodReturn, period = "monthly", type = "log") %>% 
  spread(asset, monthly.returns) %>% 
  select(date, symbols) %>% 
  slice(-1)
```

Our third method in the tidy world will produce the same output as the previous two - a `tibble` of monthly log returns - but we will also introduce the `tibbletime` package and it's function `as_period`.  As the name implies, this function allows us to cast the prices time series from daily to monthly (or weekly or quarterly etc.) in our `tibble` instead of having to apply the `to.monthly` function to the `xts` object as we did previously. 

Furthermore, unlike the previous code chunk above where we went from daily prices straight to monthly returns, here we go from daily prices to monthly prices to monthly returns.  That is, we will first create a `tibble` of monthly prices, then pipe to create monthly returns.  

We don't have a substantive reason for doing that here, but it could prove useful if there's a time when we need to get monthly prices in isolation during a tidyverse-based piped workflow.

```{r}
asset_returns_tbltime <- prices %>% 
  tk_tbl(preserve_index = TRUE, rename_index = "date") %>%
  tbl_time(index = "date") %>% 
  as_period("monthly", side = "end") %>%
  gather(asset, returns, -date) %>% 
  group_by(asset) %>% 
  tq_transmute(mutate_fun = periodReturn, type = "log") %>% 
  spread(asset, monthly.returns) %>% 
  select(date, symbols) %>% 
  slice(-1)
```

Let's take a peek at our 4 monthly log return objects.

```{r}
head(asset_returns_xts)
head(asset_returns_dplyr_byhand)
head(asset_returns_tq_builtin)
head(asset_returns_tbltime)
```
Do we notice anything of interest?

First, have a look at the left most column in each object, where the date is stored. The `asset_returns_xts` has a date index, not a column. It is accessed via `index(asset_returns_xts)`. The data frame objects have a column called "date", accessed via the `$date` convention, e.g. `asset_returns_dplyr_byhand$date`. 

Second, each of these objects is in "wide" format, which in this case means there is a column for each of our assets.  When we called `spread` at the end of the piped code flow, we put the data frames back to wide format.

This is the format that `xts` likes and it's the format that is easier to read as a human. However, the tidyverse wants this data to be in long or tidy format so that each variable has its own column.

For our asset_returns objects, that would mean a column called "date", a colum called "asset" and a column called "returns".  To see that in action, here is how it looks.

```{r}
asset_returns_long <- 
  asset_returns_dplyr_byhand %>% 
  gather(asset, returns, -date)

head(asset_returns_long)
```

We now have 3 columns and if we want to run an operation like `mutate` on each asset, we just need to call `goup_by(asset)` in the piped flow.

Before we conclude, I would be remiss without calling out an important point that I skipped for the sake of brevity. We transformed daily prices to monthly log returns, but never explained, justified or mentioned why we chose log returns instead of simple returns. 

We are making an assumption that our colleagues, collaborators or clients understand and agree with that decision.  Even if they happen to do so, we should explain our transformation as a matter of best practice: justify the logic for data transformations, even if those transformations represent a standard operating procedure. Else, we might have a team that starts to skip the logic when the data transformations are a bit more non-standard, or even controversial.  Since we might perform this prices to log returns in several projects, we could simply have one [R Notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) that our team references to explain why we use log returns. Over time, we can build a repository of documents that explain the theory behind our data tidying and transformation practices. 

### A Word on workflow and recap
 
Let's recap what we've done thus far. We have imported raw price data for 5 assets, in a reprudicible and flexible way.  We have used 4 different methods for converting those daily prices to monthly, log returns.  From those 4 methods, we now have 4 objects: `asset_returns_xts` (an xts object), `asset_returns_dplyr_byhand`, `asset_returns_tq_builtin` (a tibble object created with tidyquant and timetk) and `asset_returns_tbltime` (a tibble object created with tidyquant, timetk and tibbletime packages). 

We can think of this as step 1 in a wholistic data science workflow, that begins with data import and transformation. To make this reproducible, step 1 needs to be so crystal clear that our colleagues will find it insultingly easy to follow our work. If we wish for our work to lay the ground work for several potential projects or test strategies, this first step needs to be clear and accessible.

There's a high likelihood that we will encounter work from other team members who have their own methods for data import and transformation.  The more methods we can master or at least practice, the better prepared we will be to reuse or expand on our colleagues' work.

Data import and transofrmation is straightforward, but it also forces us to engage with our data in its rawest form, instead of skipping ahead to the model and the R squared.  To me, a data scientist can never spend too much time getting to know his/her data. Perhaps new insights will jump out, or an error will be found, or a new hypothesis.  Furthermore, when it comes time to defend or update our findings or conclusions, deep knowledge of the raw data is crucial. 


## Visualizing Asset Returns

We could jump straight into the process of converting these assets into a portfolio, but it's good practice to have a quick peek at the individual charts before doing so. I find that once a portfolio is built, we're unlikely to back track to visualizing returns on an individual basis. Yet, those individual returns are the building blocks the raw material of our portfolio. Visualizing their returns adds another chance to get to know our raw data. 

For the purposes of visualizing returns, we will work with two of our monthly log returns objects, `asset_returns_xts` and `asset_returns_long`. 

First, let's use `highcharter` to  visualize the `xts` formatted returns.

Highcharter is fantastic for visualizing a time series or many time series.  First, we set `highchart(type = "stock")` to get a nice time series line. Then we add each of our series to the highcharter code flow. In this case, we'll add our columns from the xts object.

```{r}
highchart(type = "stock") %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Monthly Log Returns") %>%
  hc_add_series(asset_returns_xts$SPY, 
                  name = names(asset_returns_xts$SPY)) %>%
  hc_add_series(asset_returns_xts$EFA, 
                  name = names(asset_returns_xts$EFA)) %>%
  hc_add_series(asset_returns_xts$IJS, 
                  name = names(asset_returns_xts$IJS)) %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_flat()) %>%
  hc_navigator(enabled = FALSE) %>% 
  hc_scrollbar(enabled = FALSE)

```

Take a look at the chart. It has a line for the monthly log returns of 3 of our ETFs (and in my opinion it's already starting to get crowded). We might be able to pull some useful intuition from this chart. Perhaps one of our ETFs remained stable the 2008 financial crisis, or had an era of consistenly negative/positive returns. Highcharter is great for plotting time series line charts.

Highcharter does have the capacity for histogram making. One method is to first call the base function `hist` on the data along with the arguments for breaks and `plot = FALSE`. Then we can call `hchart` on that object. 

```{r}
hc_spy <- hist(asset_returns_xts$SPY, breaks = 50, plot = FALSE)

hchart(hc_spy) %>% 
  hc_title(text = "SPY Log Returns Distribution")
```

For that, we will head to the tidyverse and use `ggplot2` on our tidy `tibble` `assets_returns_long`. Because it is in long, tidy format, and it is grouped by the 'asset' column, we can chart the asset histograms collectively on one chart. 

```{r}
# Make so all titles centered in the upcoming ggplots
theme_update(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

asset_returns_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = returns, fill = asset)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.25, binwidth = .01)
```

Let's use `facet_wrap(~asset)` to break these out by asset. We can add a title with `ggtitle`.

```{r}
asset_returns_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = returns, fill = asset)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.25, binwidth = .01) + 
  facet_wrap(~asset) + 
  ggtitle("Monthly Returns Since 2005")
```

Maybe we don't want to use a histogram, but instead want to use a density line to visualize the various distributions. We can use the `stat_density(geom = "line", alpha = 1)` function to do this. The `alpha` argument is selecting a line thickness. Let's also add a label to the x and y axis with the `xlab` and `ylab` functions.

```{r}

asset_returns_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = returns, colour = asset, fill = asset)) +
  stat_density(geom = "line", alpha = 1) +
  ggtitle("Monthly Returns Since 2005") +
  xlab("monthly returns") +
  ylab("distribution") 

```

That chart is quite digestible, but we can also `facet_wrap(~asset)` to break the densities out into individual charts.

```{r}
asset_returns_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = returns, colour = asset, fill = asset)) +
  stat_density(geom = "line", alpha = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~asset) +
  ggtitle("Monthly Returns Since 2005") +
  xlab("monthly returns") +
  ylab("distribution") 
```

Now we can combine all of our ggplots into one nice, faceted plot. 

At the same time, to add to the aesthetic toolkit a bit, we will do some editing to the label colors. First off, let's choose a different color besides black to be the theme. I will go with cornflower blue, because it's a nice shade and I don't see it used very frequently elsewhere. Once we have a color, we can choose the different elements of the chart to change in the the `theme` function. I make a lot of changes here by way of example but feel free to comment out a few of those lines and see the different options.


```{r}
asset_returns_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = returns, colour = asset, fill = asset)) +
  stat_density(geom = "line", alpha = 1) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.25, binwidth = .01) +
  facet_wrap(~asset) +
  ggtitle("Monthly Returns Since 2005") +
  xlab("monthly returns") +
  ylab("distribution") +
  # Lots of elements can be customized in the theme() function
  theme(plot.title = element_text(colour = "cornflowerblue"),  
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8, colour = "white"), 
        strip.background = element_rect(colour = "white", fill = "cornflowerblue"), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "cornflowerblue"), 
        axis.text = element_text(colour = "cornflowerblue"), 
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(colour = "cornflowerblue"), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "cornflowerblue"), 
        axis.ticks.y = element_line(colour = "cornflowerblue"),
        axis.title = element_text(colour = "cornflowerblue"),
        legend.title = element_text(colour = "cornflowerblue"),
        legend.text = element_text(colour = "cornflowerblue")
        )
```

We now have one chart, with histograms and line densities broken out for each of our assets. This would scale nicely if we had more assets and wanted to peek at more distributions of returns.

We have not done any substantive work today but the chart of monthly returns is a tool to quickly glance at the data and see if anything unusual jumps out, or some sort of hypothesis comes to mind. We are going to be combining these assets into a portfolio and, once that occurs, we will rarely view the assets in isolation again. Before that leap to portfolio building, it's a good idea to glance at the portfolio component distributions. 

## To the Portfolio Station

Going from a collection of individual returns to a portfolio, which is really a weighted collection of asset returns. Accordingly, the first thing we need to do is assign a weight to each portfolio. Recall that our vector of weights is `r symbols`. Let's create a weights vector that will allow us to assign a weight to each of our symbols. We are going for a balanced portfolio but we will still weight relatively little to AGG, the bond fund.


```{r, message = FALSE}
w <- c(0.25, 0.25, 0.20, 0.20, 0.10)
```

Before we use the weights in our calculations, a quick sanity check in the next code chunk is a good idea. This might not be necessary with 5 assets as we have today, but good practice because if we had 50 assets it could save us a lot of grief to catch a mistake early.

```{r Weights Sanity Check}
# Make sure the weights line up with assets.
# This is why we made sure all the return objects were in the same order as the
# `symbols` vector.
asset_weights_sanity_check <- tibble(w, symbols)
asset_weights_sanity_check

```

Does that tibble match up with the portfolio we want to create? Looks good to me.

Finally, make sure the weights sum to 100%, or 1. Again, we can eyeball this with 5 assets, but with 50 assets it would be easier to run the sanity check.

```{r}
sum(asset_weights_sanity_check$w)
```


### From Individual Returns to One Portfolio Return

We will start with the textbook equation for the return of a multi-asset portfolio which is: 
$$Return_{portfolio} = W_{1}*Return_{asset1}~+~W_{2}*Return_{asset2}~+~W_{3}*Return_{asset3}~+~W_{4}*Return_{asset4}~+~W_{5}*Return_{asset5}$$

```{r By Hand Return}

# Let's assign each asset a weight from our weights vector above.

w_1 <- w[1]
w_2 <- w[2]
w_3 <- w[3]
w_4 <- w[4]
w_5 <- w[5]

# And each asset has a return as well, stored in our 
# asset_returns_xts object.

asset1 <- asset_returns_xts[,1]
asset2 <- asset_returns_xts[,2]
asset3 <- asset_returns_xts[,3]
asset4 <- asset_returns_xts[,4]
asset5 <- asset_returns_xts[,5]

portfolio_returns_byhand <-   
  (w_1 * asset1) + 
  (w_2 * asset2) + 
  (w_3 * asset3) +
  (w_4 * asset4) + 
  (w_5 * asset5)

names(portfolio_returns_byhand) <- "returns"
```


For our first method, we will stay in the `xts` world and use the `Return.portfolio` function from the `Performance Analytics` package.  You might have noticed that we didn't explicitly load that package and that is because `tidyquant` imports this package for us.  The function requires two arguments for a portfolio, an `xts` object of returns and a vector of weights.  It's not necessary but we are also going to set `rebalance_on = "months"` so we can confirm it matches our by hand calculations above. Remember, in the by hand equation, we set the portfolio weights as fixed, meaning they never change on a month to month basis. That is equivalent to rebalancing every month. In practice, that would be quite rare. Once we confirm that it matches our by hand, we can toggle over to a more realistic annual rebalancing by chaning the argument to `rebalance_on = "years"`.


```{r}

portfolio_returns_xts_rebalanced_monthly <- 
  Return.portfolio(asset_returns_xts, weights = w, rebalance_on = "months") %>%
  `colnames<-`("returns")

```

Let's use the build in `Return.portfolio` function again but we will set a more realistic annual rebalancing with the argument `rebalance_on = "years"`.  This will change our results so that they no longer our by-hand calculation, which effectiely rebalanced every month. 

```{r}
portfolio_returns_xts_rebalanced_yearly <- 
  Return.portfolio(asset_returns_xts, weights = w, rebalance_on = "years") %>%
  `colnames<-`("returns")
```

We can take a peek at our three portfolio objects and see how the annual rebalance made a small but important difference. This will become clearer at the conclusion of this section when we calculate the growth of a dollar in the portfolio.

```{r}
head(portfolio_returns_byhand)
head(portfolio_returns_xts_rebalanced_monthly)
head(portfolio_returns_xts_rebalanced_yearly)
```

As before, we could stop here and have accomplished our substantive task (twice already - by hand and using the built in function), but we want to explore alternate methods in the world of tidyverse and tidyquant. We will use our long, tidy formatted `asset_returns_long` and convert to portfolio returns using the `tq_portfolio` function from `tidyquant`.  

The `tq_portfolio` function takes a tibble and then asks for an assets column to group by, a returns column to find return data, and a weights column. It's a wrapper for `Return.portfolio` and thus also accepts the argument `rebalance_on = "months"`.  Since we are rebalancing by months, we should again get a portfolio returns object that matches our two existing objects `portfolio_returns_byhand` and `portfolio_returns_xts_rebalanced_monthly.`   

```{r}
portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_monthly <- 
  asset_returns_long %>%
  tq_portfolio(assets_col  = asset, 
               returns_col = returns,
               weights     = w,
               col_rename  = "returns",
               rebalance_on = "months")
```

If we want rebalance annually, it'st the same code as above, except we set `rebalance_on = "years"`.

```{r}
portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_yearly <- 
  asset_returns_long %>%
  tq_portfolio(assets_col  = asset, 
               returns_col = returns,
               weights     = w,
               col_rename  = "returns",
               rebalance_on = "years")
```

We now have two more portfolio returns objects and they are both tidy tibbles. Let's take a quick look and compare how a tidy tibble of portfolio returns compares to an xts object of portfolio returns. 

```{r}
head(portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_yearly)
head(portfolio_returns_xts_rebalanced_yearly)
```

Since there is only one column of returns, there is not wide versus long format for the tibble and it looks almost identical to the `xts` object. The only difference is the date: the tibble has a column that holds the date that can be accessed with the $ operator, whereas the xts object has a date index, accessed with `index`.  

### Visualize

First, let's use `highcharter` to  visualize the `xts` formatted portfolio returns.

As we noted when looking at individual asset returns, Highcharter is fantastic for visualizing a time series or many time series.  First, we set `highchart(type = "stock")` to get a nice time series line. Then we add our `returns` column from the portfolio returns `xts` object.  We don't have to add the date index or point to it in any way. Highcharter recognizes the `xts` object and ports over the date index under the hood.

```{r}
highchart(type = "stock") %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Porftolio Monthly Returns") %>%
  hc_add_series(portfolio_returns_xts_rebalanced_yearly$returns, 
                  name = "Rebalanced Yearly", color = "cornflowerblue") %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_flat()) %>%
  hc_navigator(enabled = FALSE) %>% 
  hc_scrollbar(enabled = FALSE)

```

Let's add one of our more volatile assets and see if anything looks interesting

```{r}

highchart(type = "stock") %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Porftolio Monthly Returns") %>%
  hc_add_series(portfolio_returns_xts_rebalanced_yearly$returns, 
                  name = "Rebalanced Yearly", color = "cornflowerblue", lineWidth = 3) %>%
  hc_add_series(asset_returns_xts$IJS, 
                  name = "IJS", color = "pink", lineWidth = 1.5) %>%
   hc_add_series(asset_returns_xts$AGG, 
                  name = "AGG", color = "green", lineWidth = 1.5) %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_flat()) %>%
  hc_navigator(enabled = FALSE) %>% 
  hc_scrollbar(enabled = FALSE)
```

Take a look at the chart.

As before, we can use Highcharter for histogram making as well. One method is to first call the base function `hist` on the data along with the arguments for breaks and `plot = FALSE`. Then we can call `hchart` on that object. 

```{r}
hc_portfolio <- hist(portfolio_returns_xts_rebalanced_yearly$returns, breaks = 50, plot = FALSE)

hchart(hc_portfolio) %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Portfolio Log Returns Distribution")
```

As we noted in the previous section on asset returns, there's nothing wrong with that highcharter histogram. It displays well the distribution of portfolio returns. It does not, however, offer as much flexibility as `ggplot` for adding other distributions or density lines to the same chart. 

For that, we will head to the tidyverse and use `ggplot2` on our tidy `tibble` `portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_yearly`.

```{r}
# Make so all titles centered in the upcoming ggplots
theme_update(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_yearly %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = returns)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha = 1, binwidth = .01, fill = "cornflowerblue", color = "cornflowerblue")
```

Let's try to compare the portfolio distribution to that of our assets. Use the alpha argument to make the asset histograms a bid faded, since there are more of them and the portfolio return is what we really want to see.

```{r}
asset_returns_long %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = returns, fill = asset)) + 
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.15, binwidth = .01) +
  geom_histogram(data = portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_yearly, fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  ggtitle("Monthly Returns Since 2005")

```


Maybe we don't want to use a histogram, but instead want to use a density line to visualize the various distributions. We can use the `stat_density(geom = "line", alpha = 1)` function to do this. The `alpha` argument is selecting a line thickness. Let's also add a label to the x and y axis with the `xlab` and `ylab` functions.

```{r}

portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_yearly %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = returns)) +
  stat_density(geom = "line", alpha = 1, colour = "cornflowerblue") +
  ggtitle("Portfolio Monthly Returns Since 2005") +
  xlab("monthly returns") +
  ylab("distribution") 

```

That chart is quite digestible, but we can also `facet_wrap(~asset)` to break the densities out into individual charts.

```{r}
# could also combine to one for v

portf_asset_returns_density <- 
  ggplot(data =  asset_returns_long, 
         aes(x = returns)) +
  stat_density(geom = "line", 
               alpha = 1,
               aes(colour = asset)) +
  stat_density(data = portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_yearly, 
               geom = "line",
               alpha = 1,
               aes(colour = returns)) +
  ggtitle("Portfolio and Asset Monthly Returns Since 2005") +
  xlab("monthly returns") +
  ylab("distribution") 

portf_asset_returns_density
```

Now let's put portfolio returns histogram and density on one plot.

```{r}
portfolio_returns_tq_rebalanced_yearly %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = returns)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 1, binwidth = .01, colour = "cornflowerblue", fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  stat_density(geom = "line", alpha = 1, color = "pink") +
  ggtitle("Portfolio Monthly Returns Since 2005") +
  xlab("monthly returns") +
  ylab("distribution") +
  # Lots of elements can be customized in the theme() function
  theme(plot.title = element_text(colour = "cornflowerblue"), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "cornflowerblue"), 
        axis.text = element_text(colour = "cornflowerblue"), 
        axis.ticks.x = element_line(colour = "cornflowerblue"), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "cornflowerblue"), 
        axis.ticks.y = element_line(colour = "cornflowerblue"),
        axis.title = element_text(colour = "cornflowerblue")
        )
```


We have covered the process of importing daily price data for 5 assets, converting to monthly log returns for those assets, and then converting to portfolio returns after assigning weights to those assets. 


```{r}
portfolio_growth_byhand <- cumprod(1 + portfolio_returns_byhand$returns)
```


```{r}
portfolio_growth_xts_rebalanced_monthly <- 
  Return.portfolio(asset_returns_xts, 
                   wealth.index = 1, weights = w, rebalance_on = "months") %>%
  `colnames<-`("growth") 

```

Now on to 

```{r}
portfolio_growth_tq_rebalanced_monthly <- 
  asset_returns_long %>%
  tq_portfolio(assets_col  = asset, 
               returns_col = returns,
               weights     = w,
               col_rename  = "returns",
               rebalance_on = "months", 
               wealth.index = 1) %>% 
  slice(-1)
  
```


Let's explore one more method using the `purrr` package from the tidyverse. `purrr` contains a lot of useful functions and the `map()` family is most used, but another very useful function is `accumulate()`. As the name implies, this function allows us to accumulate calculations in a recursive way, meaning we can use prior calculations the same way we would in a for loop or with `cumprod()`. We will make use of this when we get to monte carlo simulations. The code below shows how to use accumulate to get the growth of a dollar. 

```{r}
portfolio_growth_purrr <- 
  asset_returns_long %>%
  tq_portfolio(assets_col  = asset, 
               returns_col = returns,
               weights     = w,
               col_rename  = "returns",
               rebalance_on = "months") %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  mutate(growth_1 = accumulate(1 + returns, `*`),
         growth_2 = accumulate(1 + returns, function(x, y) x * y)) %>% 
  select(date, growth_1, growth_2)
```

We've now calculated the growth of a dollar in several ways: using cumprod and dplyr, using the built-in functions with `perfromanceAnalytics` and `tidyquant`, and using the `accumulate()` function from `purrr`. Let's confirm that we got consistent results.  

```{r}
final_comparison <- 
  merge.xts(portfolio_growth_byhand, portfolio_growth_xts_rebalanced_monthly) %>% 
  tk_tbl(preserve_index = TRUE, rename_index = "date") %>% 
  bind_cols(portfolio_growth_purrr) %>% 
  select(-date1) %>% 
  bind_cols(portfolio_growth_tq_rebalanced_monthly) %>% 
  select(-date1) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("date", "by_hand", "xts", "purrr1", "purrr2", "tq"))
```

A lot of grinding but we can be confident in these methods and the results, and should any of our colleagues wish to reproduce our results and extend them, a plethora of code paths is available to them. Our different object structures will also lend themselves to different visualizations techniques which was our original motivation here, to create a more intuitive way to understand our returns. Most investors care about how their money grows on a cumulative basis and monthly returns, though interesting to quantitative types and distribution aficianados, can be difficult to interpret. Growth of a dollar is not a perfect measure of a portfolio's quality (we haven't even gotten to risk yet!) but it's where many people will start. Let's chart it. 

```{r}
library(highcharter)

highchart(type = "stock") %>% 
  hc_title(text = "Growth of a Dollar") %>%
  hc_add_series(portfolio_growth_xts_rebalanced_monthly, 
                  name = "Portfolio", color = "cornflowerblue", lineWidth = 1) %>%
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "growth of dollar"),
           opposite = FALSE,
           labels = list(format = "${value}")) %>% 
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_flat()) %>%
  hc_navigator(enabled = FALSE) %>% 
  hc_scrollbar(enabled = FALSE)
```



```{r}
library(scales)
portfolio_growth_purrr %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = growth_1)) + 
  geom_line(colour = "cornflowerblue") + 
  ylab("dollar growth") +
  xlab("month") +
  ggtitle("Growth of a Dollar") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = pretty_breaks(n = 10), labels = dollar) +
  scale_x_date(breaks = pretty_breaks(n = 10))
```


For this pure time series plotting, `highcharter` offers a slightly better aesthetic experience since it allows the end user to choose different time frames. That will come in very handy when take our work to Shiny in the next section. 

Before we leave the returns to dollar growth substance,
